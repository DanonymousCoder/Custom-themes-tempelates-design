## Customizing CMS Themes 

Welcome to our project on customizing CMS (Content Management System) themes! In this guide, we'll explain everything step by step, like we're talking to a baby. 🍼

### What is this project about?
We are making websites look super pretty! 🌈 We're taking ready-made website designs and making them even more awesome. It's like giving a toy a new coat of paint!

### What do you need?

A computer 💻
A CMS like WordPress or Joomla (we'll use WordPress here)
A code editor (it's like a fancy crayon box for websites)

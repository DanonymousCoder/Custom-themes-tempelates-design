## Customizing CMS Themes 

Welcome to our project on customizing CMS (Content Management System) themes! In this guide, we'll explain everything step by step, like we're talking to a baby. 🍼

### What is this project about?
We are making websites look super pretty! 🌈 We're taking ready-made website designs and making them even more awesome. It's like giving a toy a new coat of paint!

### What do you need? 

A computer 💻
A CMS like WordPress or Joomla (we'll use WordPress here)
A code editor (it's like a fancy crayon box for websites)

### Step-by-Step Guide:

### 1. Choose Your CMS 🖥️

We're using WordPress because it's friendly and lots of people use it. You can get it for free!

### 2. Find a Design Template 🎨

Go to free websites like Colorlib or ThemeForest to find cool design templates. Pick one you like!

### 3. Install WordPress 🚀

Follow the baby-simple instructions on the WordPress website to install it on your computer.

### 4. Create a Child Theme 👶

We want to play safely, so make a "child theme." It's like a coloring book that won't mess up the original.
Customize the Design 🎉

Use HTML and CSS to make the website look just the way you want. Change colors, fonts, and layouts!
